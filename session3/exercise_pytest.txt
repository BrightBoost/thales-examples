Write a test function that tests the behavior of the following function:

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

Your test function should test the add function with a variety of input values and verify that the output is correct.


2. Write a test function that tests the behavior of the following function:

def divide(x, y):
    return x / y

Use a test fixture to set up a known state for the test, and then use the divide function to test the behavior of the function.


3. Write a test function that tests the behavior of the following function:
def calculate_mean(values):
    return sum(values) / len(values)
    
Use the parametrize decorator to define multiple sets of arguments for the test function, and then use the calculate_mean function to test the behavior of the function with each set of arguments.
